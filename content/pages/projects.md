Class Project Presentations
---------------------------

Toward the beginning of the seminar, students will organize into groups. Each group will select an industry with which they are familiar, identify a major new technology that can significantly transform businesses within that industry, and put together a plan for how to transform such a business, including technical and market strategies, organization and culture. Each group will develop a strategy document, as well as summarize it in a presentation which they will present and discuss with the rest of the class.
